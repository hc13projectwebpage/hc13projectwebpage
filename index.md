How will the L train closure affect our neighborhood? 
In Williamsburg, particularly the Bedford Avenue station, there is an average of 2,000 subway riders that ride on a weekday between 4am and 8am. Multiplied by five, the number of weekdays, there are approximately 10,000 subway riders. Assuming that most of these passengers use the subway for work, this is the approximate number of people who will be affected by the L train closure every week. As an alternative, if the Empire State Building is the final destination, Williamsburg residents can take the B62 bus to the Greenpoint Av station (G train). From there, they can take the G train to Court Sq-23rd St, from which they can transfer to the E or 7 train that will take them to Manhattan. This is the fastest way to get to Midtown or Uptown Manhattan. If the Federal Hall is their final destination, Williamsburg residents can take the B24 bus to the Marcy Av station (J/Z train). From there, they can take the J or Z train to the Fulton Av station. This is the fastest way to reach Downtown Manhattan.

In Cypress Hills (Broadway-Junction station), there are approximately 62,496 people who are affected by the loss of the L train (J, Z and L trains share this stop, the calculations did not account for this). The most practical temporary replacement of the L train are 3 bus lanes for the 4 morning hours. Cars and bikes are also other possible transportation options. The other subway lines, especially the J and the Z, should be able to accomodate for most trips to Manhattan.

In Greenwich Village, closure of the L in the 14th street and 8th avenue station would greatly affect people commuting into Brooklyn and into the east side of Manhattan. There arenâ€™t many other ways to get to the east side or into Brooklyn. The turnstile data does not accurately depict how many people will be affected by this closure because the station also operates ACE trains. There is a bus that runs along 14th street in Manhattan which means people can take it in lieu of the L train. However, it is estimated to take a significantly longer time. In order to get from 14th street and 8th avenue to 14th street and 1st avenue, it takes approximately an extra twenty minutes. In order to get to Brooklyn from the city, commuters will need to take significant detours which may add up to on hour to their commute so a ferry where the L train goes into Brooklyn may be helpful as well as a bus that runs the same route as the L train in Brooklyn. Since the closure is lasting 15 months, this would be a good short time compromise.
